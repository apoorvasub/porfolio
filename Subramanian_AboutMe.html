                        <p> My name is Apoorva Subramanian, and I am currently a sophomore in Dublin High
                        School. I aspire to contribute to the field of medicine by becoming a pediatrician. I am
                        very passionate about this field because it combines my interests in biology,
                        chemistry and health sciences. For as long as I could remember, becoming a doctor
                        has always been a dream of mine, and I intend to pursue it. 
                        </p></br>
                        <p>In order to make my dream a reality, I plan on taking advanced courses in the sciences and mathematics,
                        in addition to obtaining experience in the field. I hope to volunteer in a nearby 
                        hospital and shadow doctors to familiarize myself with the profession. In addition,
                        I plan to be a high school intern in a University of California, San Franciso
                        research facility. I am interested in attending universities such as University of California, Los Angeles and University of California, Davis.

                        <p>The process to become a doctor is very strenuous and requires incredible commitment
                        and perseverance. I believe that I am well suited for this career because I am a 
                        very driven individual and work very diligently to complete every task. I have 
                        demonstrated excellance in studies  throughout my schooling. I have
                        developed the ability to easily adapt and thrive in different environments. Some of my
                        achievements include maintaining Honor Roll throughout middle school and getting a 4.0/4.0 unweighted grade point average during 
                        both semesters of freshman year in one of the top Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math schools in the nation. 
                        My experiences as a freshman revealed that I work well under pressure and in stressful situations.
                        Over the last couple years, I have learned the importance of persistence, confidence and assertiveness. 
                        This is something I had struggled with when I was younger, but have improved in over the years.
