                            <p> My partner and I worked together to create our own game, Balloon Pop, based on the basic prewritten MIT App Inventor code for the game,
                            Space Invaders. We both worked to modify and add to the code to make it our own. Since we were unfamiliar
                            with the program before making the game, it was time consuming to do simple tasks that others who had 
                            experience could do quickly. In addition, we trouble with our code breaking at times. Luckily, we had an early version of the project to fall back on and code from. However, we were 
                            able to overcome these setbacks because we utilized to tutorials on App Inventor to familiarize ourselves
                            with the program, and we were able to take advantage of the internet and our teacher for any questions we had. 
                            This project helped me successfully learned how to use MIT App Inventor.

                            <p>My partner and I worked together to create our own game, The Secret of Arcadia High School, using
                            our skills on Scratch. Our game is a virtual scavenger hunt in which the players have to
                            find three keys using the given clues. Once they have found all the keys, they will be 
                            given a fourth and final clue about where the secret of Arcadia High School is hidden. 
                            Once the player finds the secret, they have won the game. We had difficulty coding some
                            parts of the game, but were able to conduct a quick search on the internet, and consult
                            our instructor to resolve any questions we had. In addition, in order to avoid the risk of our code 
                            breaking, we saved several early <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/173303445/">versions</a>
                            of our game. By the end of this project, I had successfully learned how to use Scratch. For more

                            <p>My partner and I worked together to create our own
                            text adventure game in which the player is given the 
                            task of rescuing a princess and must search the 
                            various locations provided to find her. The game
                            uses user input to select which location to search 
                            and offers several dead ends to make the game more 
                            challenging. In addition, the game allows the player 
                            to begin the search all over again. We had some 
                            difficulty getting the game to work but with the 
                            help of our instruction, we were able to figure out 
                            the issues and resolve them. To take a look at the
